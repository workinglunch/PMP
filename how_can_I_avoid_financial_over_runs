As a lead project manager, avoiding financial overruns while remaining a servant leader involves a strategic blend of proactive planning, vigilant monitoring, and empowering your team, all underpinned by strong communication and a focus on continuous value delivery. 
Financial overruns occur when actual project costs exceed the approved budget, jeopardising project success. A servant leader focuses on understanding and addressing the needs and development of project team members, sharing power, putting the team's needs first, removing obstacles, shielding the team from distractions, and providing guidance and support.
Here's how you can achieve this balance:
• Proactive Planning and Realistic Estimation:
    ◦ Just-in-Time Planning: Adopt a "just-in-time" approach, planning just enough when needed in support of a strategic product goal, rather than attempting to lock in scope and price at the project start when the least is known. This adaptability avoids wasteful functionality.
    ◦ Accurate Estimates from the Team: Ensure that the developers who will do the work provide effort estimates for requirements, using relative estimates instead of absolute hours or days to accurately tailor estimated effort to their knowledge and capabilities. As a servant leader, you rely on and trust developers' sizing of work and feasibility.
    ◦ Comprehensive Cost Planning: Develop a comprehensive Cost Management Plan that defines how project costs will be estimated, budgeted, monitored, controlled, and reported. This includes accounting for direct and indirect costs, regulatory and compliance costs, and contingency and management reserves.
    ◦ Incremental Funding: Instead of allocating funding for the entire development effort upfront, consider incrementally funding products, for example, allocating 90 days' worth of funding and evaluating the value created before funding further. This allows for direct funding toward products providing expected value and reduces investment in underperforming initiatives.
    ◦ Clear Objectives and Scope: Begin by establishing the project's initial scope and objectives and securing authorisation to lay the foundation for a successful project. A well-defined scope helps prevent unnecessary work and ensures all required work is included.
• Vigilant Monitoring and Control:
    ◦ Continuous Monitoring: Continuously monitor project status, comparing actual costs to planned expenditures and managing reserve usage . Apply Earned Value Management (EVM) to measure performance against the cost baseline, providing insight into cost and schedule performance .
    ◦ Robust Change Control: Implement a robust change control process to formally evaluate and approve all budget, schedule, and scope adjustments throughout the project lifecycle. This prevents "scope creep"—the uncontrolled expansion of work without formal acknowledgement and acceptance of changes or their associated costs.
    ◦ Regular Inspection and Adaptation: Conduct regular inspection and adaptation cycles, such as sprint reviews and retrospectives. Sprint reviews are excellent opportunities to reflect with transparency on the remaining budget and evaluate the value of the remaining backlog.
    ◦ Limit Work in Progress (WIP): Encourage the team to limit work in progress (WIP) to ensure items get completed faster and feedback is received quickly. Parallel product work leads to lower productivity due to context switching, which can cost as much as 40 percent of productive time.
    ◦ Focus on Value over Specification: Remember that 80 percent of features developed under a waterfall model are infrequently or never used. Focus on solving customer problems and developing only necessary features to fulfill the product goal. When the actual cost plus the opportunity cost of future development is greater than its value, stop or shift development to a more valuable initiative. This practice, known as capital redeployment, helps in lowering costs.
• Servant Leadership in Action for Cost Control:
    ◦ Remove Impediments and Shield from Diversions: A critical role for a servant leader is to maximise delivery by removing impediments and shielding the project team from internal and external diversions that redirect them from current objectives. Time fragmentation reduces productivity.
    ◦ Empower the Team: Allow project teams to self-organise and increase their autonomy by passing appropriate decision-making opportunities to them. Trusting the team to decide how to accomplish work can lead to skyrocketing productivity. Empowered teams can often find efficient, cost-saving solutions.
    ◦ Manage Conflict Constructively: Project managers face mutually exclusive constraints like budget, scope, schedule, and quality, which can lead to conflicts. As a servant leader, you would negotiate and prioritise conflicting budget requirements based on project objectives and constraints . Effective conflict management leads to better decision-making and stronger solutions, preventing costly delays.
    ◦ Foster Transparency and Open Communication: Create a transparent working environment with open communication channels, where stakeholders can raise concerns without penalty or fear. Transparency helps the team make necessary adjustments through empirical process control.
    ◦ Promote a Sustainable Pace: Encourage the team to work at a sustainable pace, avoiding excessive long hours or overtime, as this can lead to mistakes, burnout, and increased costs later on. High-performing teams maintain quality and productivity over the long term.
• Ethical Conduct:
    ◦ Do Not Inflate Estimates: As per the PMI code of ethics, always provide accurate information and do not inflate estimates. This ensures transparency and builds trust with stakeholders.
By integrating these practices, a lead project manager can effectively manage project finances and avoid overruns, all while embodying the principles of servant leadership and fostering a high-performing, empowered team.
